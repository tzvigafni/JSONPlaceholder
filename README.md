# Getting Started with Create React App

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### 
Check your browser's local storage,
Data will automatically enter your local storage, of all registered users.
They can be seen at -
'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users'
that make a call to it on the Home.js page

On the Login.js page it is required to enter a username and password,
The username is the username of a registered user, and the password is 4 digits that are inside the "address" inside the "geo" inside the "lat" - the last four digits.

For example, this is the first user -
 
[{"id":1,"name":"Leanne Graham","username":"Bret","email":"Sincere@april.biz","address":{"street":"Kulas Light","suite":"Apt. 556","city":"Gwenborough","zipcode":"92998-3874","geo":{"lat":"-37.3159","lng":"81.1496"}},"phone":"1-770-736-8031 x56442","website":"hildegard.org","company":{"name":"Romaguera-Crona","catchPhrase":"Multi-layered client-server neural-net","bs":"harness real-time e-markets"}}]

Therefore the username is - Bret
And the password is - 3159

good luck!
